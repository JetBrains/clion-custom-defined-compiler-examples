Test project for Custom Compiler feature
===

This project is an example how to use [ARMCC](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5)
with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
using [Custom Defined Compiler](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2021/10/clion-2021-3-eap-custom-compiler/)

There is a custom compiler definition file for the compiler: [custom-compiler-armcc.yaml](custom-compiler-armcc.yaml)
