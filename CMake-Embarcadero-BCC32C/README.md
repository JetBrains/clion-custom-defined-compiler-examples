Test project for Custom Compiler Feature
===

This project is an example how to use [Embarcadero Free C Compiler](https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/ccompiler) 
with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
using [Custom Defined Compiler](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-9615)

There is a custom compiler definition file for the compiler: [custom-compiler-bcc-msp430.yaml](custom-compiler-bcc.yaml)

**NB**: The compiler is supposed to be installed to `c:\tools\bcc102` folder
