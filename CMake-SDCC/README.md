Test project for Custom Compiler feature
===

This project is an example how to use [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) for stm8
with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
using [Custom Defined Compiler](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-9615)

There is a custom compiler definition file for the compiler: [custom-compiler-sdcc-stm8.yaml](custom-compiler-sdcc-stm8.yaml)
