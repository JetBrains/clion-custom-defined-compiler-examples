Test project for Custom Compiler Feature
===

This project is an example how to use [TI MSP430 CGT compiler](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-CGT) 
with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
using [Custom Defined Compiler](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-9615)

There is a custom compiler definition file for the compiler: [custom-compiler-msp430.yaml](custom-compiler-msp430.yaml)
